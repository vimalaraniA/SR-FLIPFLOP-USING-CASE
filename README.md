# SR-FLIPFLOP-USING-CASE

**AIM:**

To implement  SR flipflop using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

SR Flip-Flop SR flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, SR latch operates with enable signal. The circuit diagram of SR flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has two inputs S & R and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of SR flipflop is similar to SR Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable. The following table shows the state table of SR flip-flop.

Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, SR flip-flop can be used for one of these three functions such as Hold, Reset & Set based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of SR flip-flop. Present Inputs Present State Next State

By using three variable K-Map, we can get the simplified expression for next state, Qt+1t+1. The three variable K-Map for next state, Qt+1t+1 is shown in the following figure.

The maximum possible groupings of adjacent ones are already shown in the figure. Therefore, the simplified expression for next state Qt+1t+1 is Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)

**Procedure**

1.Define Module : Define a Verilog module for SR flip-flop with inputs (S,R) and outputs (Q,Q_bar).

2.Declare Inputs and Outputs : Declare input and output ports for the module.

3.Implement Flip-Flop Logic: Write Verilog code to implement the SR flip-flop logic based on its functional table.

4.Simulate Using Testbench: Write a Verilog testbench to simulate the behavior of the SR flip-flop under different input conditions.

5.Apply Input Stimuli: In the testbench, apply various combinations of input stimuli (S, R) to cover all possible input states.

6.Verify Output Behavior: Verify that the output behavior of the SR flip-flop matches the expected behavior defined by its functional table.

7.Check for Race Conditions: Ensure that there are no race conditions or undefined states in the design by analyzing the timing and sequence of input changes.
